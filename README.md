## Introduction

Package Uploader is a .NET 8.0-based cross-platform application and library that enables game developers to interact programmatically with Partner Center.

Package Uploader has a command-line tool and a dynamic linked library (DLL) that you can integrate into your build pipelines or other development workflows.

The initial 1.0 release of Package Uploader provides the following functionality.

* Retrieves metadata about a particular product
* Uploads a new Xbox XVC, UWP, or MSIXVC package
* Removes existing or previous packages
* Imports packages from one branch to another
* Publishes packages to a sandbox

<a id="prerequisites"></a>

## Prerequisites

Programmatic manipulation of packages for a particular product requires the following:

* The product must already exist in Partner Center. The tool currently doesn't support product creation.
* The branch for the target upload must already exist in Partner Center. The tool currently doesn't support branch creation.
* The target product must have been previously fully published to a sandbox before the Package Uploader can be used. A full publishing includes all modules like properties, store listing, pricing and availabilities, and packages.
* Access to create Azure application registrations in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant connected to the target Partner Center account.
* You only need a valid certificate if you plan on setting up certificate-based authorization.
* The Package Uploader executable.

<a id="service-creation-and-authentication"></a>

## Service creation and authentication

### Create an Azure AD application for authentication

1. Sign in to your company's [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Azure Active Directory**.<br>**NOTE:** Ensure that this is the same Azure AD that's linked to your Partner Center account.
2. Select **App registrations**.
3. Select **New registration**.
4. Enter a name for the application.
5. From the list of supported account types, select **Single tenant**.
6. Leave **Redirect URI** blank. It isn't required for this application.
7. Select **Register**.
8. Make note of the following information for your new application.
    * Application (client) ID
    * Directory (tenant) ID

You’ll use the Client ID and Directory ID that you’ve generated and noted for the remaining sections in this article. 

For more information, see [Quickstart: Register an app in the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application). 

### Setup authorization 

The tool currently supports either app secrets or certificates. Perform one of the following procedures to setup authorization.

#### Create a secret key

1. Select **Certificates & secrets**.
2. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**.
3. Enter a description of the secret, and then specify a duration. When you're done, select **Add**.
4. After adding the client secret, the value of the secret key is displayed.<br>**NOTE:** Copy this value because you won't be able to retrieve the secret key later.

#### Register a certificate

1. Select **Certificates & secrets**.
2. Select **Upload certificate**.
3. Navigate to the certificate you want to use and select it for uploading.
4. After the certificate has uploaded you should see it in the table of certificates, showing its start date and expiry date..<br>**NOTE:** Copy the thumbprint because you will use it later.


### Grant the newly created service permission to the game product

1.  Sign into Partner Center as a user with Manager level account permissions.
2.  Select **Settings** (gear icon) in the top right, and then select **Account Settings**.
3.  In the left pane select **User Management** and then select **Azure AD Applications**.
4.  Select **Add Azure AD Application**, then click **Add Azure AD Application** again in the pop up that appears. Select the Azure application you created in the previous steps and then select **Next**.<br>**NOTE:** If your application doesn’t appear, ensure that you created it in the same tenant that’s linked to Partner Center.
5.  On the top tab, select **Customize permissions**.
6.  Find the product that you want to programmatically upload builds to. Grant your Azure application the **Read/Write** permission under **Publishing**. For more information, see [Add an Azure AD tenant to your account](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/multi-tenant-account#add-an-azure-ad-tenant-to-your-account).

## Get the Package Uploader

To use the Package Uploader, you can download the latest executable from the [Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/PackageUploader/releases/latest).<br>**NOTE:** No need to install the .NET Runtime to run the tool since it is included inside the binary.

Alternatively, you can also build it.

1. [Download .NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or the latest version.
2. Open a powershell prompt, and then browse to the folder where you downloaded the Package Uploader.
3. Browse to the `src` folder and then run `./publish.win-x64.ps1`.
4. When it's built, PackageUploader.exe is in the `src\PackageUploader.Application\bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish` directory.

<a id="run-the-package-uploader"></a>

## Run the Package Uploader

Running the package uploader requires three arguments.

| Argument | Description |
| --- | ---|
| **Operation Name** | The operation represents the action that you want to perform. It should match the name of the configuration file that you pass when running the tool.
| **Configuration file** | The configuration file contains all the information that's required to perform the intended action. It specifies your product information, file locations, and the tenant authorized to complete the action. Copy a template from the templates folder and fill in the required fields to ensure you have all the data necessary.
| **Client secret** | This is the alphanumeric value that you previously generated, which is required to authenticate with Partner Center and your product.

### Available operations

| Operation | Description |
| --- | ---|
| **[GetProduct](https://github.com/microsoft/PackageUploader/blob/main/Operations.md#GetProduct)** | Gets metadata for the product. This is useful for getting the productId, BigId, product name that's used in all configuration files. And a list of the BranchFriendlyNames and FlightNames of the product. |
| **[GetPackages](https://github.com/microsoft/PackageUploader/blob/main/Operations.md#GetPackages)** | Gets a list of the packages in a branch or flight. |
| **[UploadUwpPackage](https://github.com/microsoft/PackageUploader/blob/main/Operations.md#UploadUwpPackage)** | Uploads a UWP game package. |
| **[UploadXvcPackage](https://github.com/microsoft/PackageUploader/blob/main/Operations.md#UploadXvcPackage)** | Uploads a XVC game package and assets, including EKB, SubVal, and layout files. |
| **[RemovePackages](https://github.com/microsoft/PackageUploader/blob/main/Operations.md#RemovePackages)** | Removes game packages and assets from a branch. We recommend keeping only your 10 most recent packages to ensure optimal performance. |

<a id="available-authentication-methods"></a>

### Available Authentication methods

| Authentication method | Description |
| --- | ---|
| AppSecret | Uses a confidential client application to authenticate with Microsoft Entra using a client secret. |
| AppCert | Uses a confidential client application to authenticate with Microsoft Entra using a client certificate. |
| Default | Uses the Azure Identity DefaultAzureCredential method to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. Simplifies authentication by combining credentials. See Usage guidance for [DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication/credential-chains?tabs=dac#defaultazurecredential-overview). |
| Browser | Uses the Azure Identity InteractiveBrowserCredential method to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. A TokenCredential implementation which launches the system default browser to interactively authenticate a user, and obtain an access token. The browser will only be launched to authenticate the user once, then will silently acquire access tokens through the users refresh token as long as it's valid. |
| AzureCli | Uses the Azure Identity AzureCliCredential method to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. If the user is authenticated to Azure using Azure CLI's az login command, authenticate the app to Azure using that same account. |
| ManagedIdentity | Uses the Azure Identity ManagedIdentityCredential method to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. Attempts authentication using a managed identity that has been assigned to the deployment environment. This authentication type works for all Azure-hosted environments that support managed identity. More information about configuring managed identities can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). |
| Environment | Uses the Azure Identity EnvironmentCredential method to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. Enables authentication to Microsoft Entra ID using a client secret or certificate, or as a user with a username and password, using environment variables. Order and environment variables can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.environmentcredential). |
| AzurePipelines | Uses the Azure Identity AzurePipelinesCredential method to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. Credential which authenticates using an Azure Pipelines service connection. For usage instructions, see [Authenticating in Azure Pipelines with service connections](https://aka.ms/azsdk/net/identity/azurepipelinescredential/usage). |
| ClientSecret | Uses the Azure Identity ClientSecretCredential method to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. Enables authentication to Microsoft Entra ID using a client secret that was generated for an App Registration. More information on how to configure a client secret can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#add-credentials-to-your-web-application). |
| ClientCertificate | Uses the Azure Identity ClientCertificateCredential method to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. Enables authentication of a service principal to Microsoft Entra ID using a X509 certificate that is assigned to its App Registration. More information on how to configure certificate authentication can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/certificate-credentials#register-your-certificate-with-microsoft-identity-platform). |

## Troubleshooting
In some cases, Package Uploader might not work as you intended. Here's a list of some of the most common errors that users have encountered while using Package Uploader, and their possible solutions. A best practice for debugging is to open the folder where the tool runs from and your configuration files are saved. Open the specific configuration file that you've selected to ensure you're not using the blank template.

**NOTE:** A schema is available for validating configuration files in Visual Studio or any tool of your choice. The schema is located at [https://product-ingestion-int.azureedge.net/schema/package-uploader-operation-configuration/2021-11-30](https://product-ingestion-int.azureedge.net/schema/package-uploader-operation-configuration/2021-11-30).

* `Exception: System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: Response status code does not indicate success: 401`<br>
You haven't correctly setup your application authentication. Ensure that you've added your application to the Azure AD Applications section with the appropriate access.

* `Invalid client secret is provided.`<br>
Check the format of your client secret because it doesn't match the values specified for your ClientId and TenetId.

* `Product with BigId 'SomeBigID' not found`<br>
Ensure that you've entered your BigID or StoreId correctly.

* `'OperationName' with the error: 'OperationName field is not GetProduct.'`<br>
You've specified an unsupported operation. Check the list of supported operations and ensure you've entered the operation correctly.

* `Check to make sure you have the correct tenant ID and are signing into the correct cloud.`<br>
Either your ClientId or TenantId are incorrect in your configuration file. Ensure that you're using the correct configuration file and that the IDs are correct.

* `Unhandled exception: System.FormatException: Could not parse the JSON file. ---> System.Text.Json.JsonReaderException: 'U' is an invalid escapable character within a JSON string. The string should be correctly escaped
`<br>
You must escape all backslashes and parentheses in JSON with a backslash, for example: `C:\\`.

* `Failed to publish.`<br>
Ensure your destination branch or sandbox already exists. If not, initialize it via the Partner Center portal and try again 

* `Failed to publish. - You can only have one MSIXVC package per market group.`<br>
You have uploaded two packages to the same branch. Use the Partner Center portal to delete all extra packages for the given market group.

<a id="q-and-a"></a>

## Q &amp; A

**Q:** Can I use one Azure app name for multiple products?<br>
**A:** No. We're currently working with the Partner Center team to make this possible. For now, each product you upload requires the creation of a unique Azure AD application.

**Q:** Are delta uploads supported?<br>
**A:** Yes! For XVC and MSIXVC packages, delta upload will work the same as uploading direct in to Partner Center. Consult your DAM for how this works with your product and packages. UWP unfortunately is not supported and will not be in the future either.

**Q:** Can I upload multiple packages for the same product at the same time?<br>
**A:** No. You'll need to upload packages one at a time.

**Q:** Can I source my builds off another machine?
